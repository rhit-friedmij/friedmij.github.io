          <p>
              Shown below are the projects I have created throughout my time as a
              student at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. They display my propensity
              for group-based work as well as my proficiency in a variety of material.

              <li>
                <h2><a href="#">Processor Development Project</a></h2>
                <img src="images/portfolio/processorProject.png" height="300em">
                <p>For this project, I worked with a team to write an assembly language to
                    be implemented on a processor designed through the Xilinx IDE. I acquired
                    experience in constructing design documents, writing a final report, and 
                    taking succinct and comprehensive meeting minutes. I also worked with the
                    team to craft a presentation given about the design process and the overall
                    fundamentals of our processor.

                <h2><a href="#">National Park Route Creator</a></h2>
                <img src="images/portfolio/parkProject.png" height="300em">
                <p>In this project, I collaborated with a team to implement Dijkstra's Algorithm
                    to compute the shortest path between any two national parks in the continental
                    United States. I coordinated complicated schedules during the confusion at the
                    beginning of the pandemic to have sufficient time to meet as a team. I specifically
                    handled the graphic design of the UI, building the program up from a bare-bones 
                    algorithm.

                <h2><a href="#">Database Development Project</a></h2>
                <img src="images/portfolio/databaseProject.png">
                <p>In the Database Development Project, I, alongside a team, constructed a database
                    through SQL Server Management Studio to store the information contained within
                    the Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition Monster Manual. This involved storing data
                    that described each creature throughout related tables. We constructed a Java
                    program to connect to the database and a User Interface where one could view
                    the information stored within the database and modify the information contained
                    depending on permissions. We also created a design document for this project
                    that included an Entity Relationship diagram as well as a Relational Schema.

                  <img src="images/portfolio/arcadeProject.png" height="300em">
                  <p>In this project, I worked with a partner to program the 1982 arcade game Joust
                      through a Java swing environment. This project dealt with entity tracking and
                      graphical changes that followed algorithmically supported changes at a consistent
                      movement rate. I compiled a comprehensive presentation detailing the design issues
                      with the project as well as the overall process and final product.
