          <h1>Isaac Friedman</h1>
          <img src="images/avatar.jpg" height="300em">
          <p>I am a Sophomore Software Engineering Major at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Techonology,
              where I am working every day to improve my programming experience in hopes of kickstarting my
              career in programming. I am interested in web development, specifically front-end design,
              but would like to explore all aspects of the career. I excel in team environments, with much
              leadership experience under my belt, I feel confident in any group setting.
          </p>
            
          <p>Outside of programming, I participate in improv and theater activities at my university,
              holding a leadership position in both and working towards a minor in theater. Alongside performing
              arts, I enjoy reading books in my spare time as well as following politics and playing games.
